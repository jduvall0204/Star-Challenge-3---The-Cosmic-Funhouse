You''ve just come aboard the space station Nebula, home of the peacekeeping 
and investigation branch of the NETWORK OF WORLDS. From this man-made satellite you, 
as a Nebula operative, will go out into the galaxy, taking care of trouble.

The Nebula''s teleportation system can send you anywhere in the galaxy, instantly. 
Or you can pilot your own shuttle spacecraft, the Challenger. If you need help 
at any time, feel free to send to the Nebula for reinforcements.

Remember, the success or failure of your mission (not to mention your own survival) will 
depend on your choices. Successful Nebula operatives are people who can make quick, thoughtful decisions.

Hurry! CAPTAIN POLARIS needs you!')

You''re a bit out of breath when you reach the busy Teleportation Room of the artificial 
moon called the Nebula. Judging by your clammy palms, you''re a little nervous, too. After 
all, you''re still a new recruit.

Polaris greets you with a smile. "I have a rather unusual assignment for you," he says. 
"It''ll probably be more fun than training camp down on Centaurus A. But," he adds, 
"it may be a little more dangerous, too."

"2-Tor and I are ready for some excitement," you reply. "What''s the job?"

"Have you ever visited the Amusement Planet?" he asks.

"No. My parents always talked about going there, but we never got around to it."

Captain Polaris turns to 2-Tor. "What do you know about it?" he asks.

"It''s a medium-sized planet" 2-Tor clicks and buzzes. "It''s had its amusement function 
for about eighty years. Main attraction: The Cosmic Funhouse. It''s all run by the Kron from the Algol system."

"Where''s that?" you ask.

"Perseus. Triple star," he replies. "The Amusement Planet seems to have had its 
heyday about forty years ago. It''s a bit run-down now. That''s all the information I have."')

Something funny is happening there, and I want you to take a look. Find out 
what''s going on. If it''s a danger to the Network of Worlds, put an end to it."

You and 2-Tor climb aboard the Challenger. 
You set the shuttle''s controls for the Amusement Planet.

"Boy, it really is an unusual assignment," you whistle. 
"I wonder if we should try to sneak in there without being seen."

"Or," suggests 2-Tor, "we could dress up as tourists and snoop around."

Unfortunately his information is a bit out of date. The warehouse is no 
longer there. You materialize in the middle of a huge crowd. Luckily, no one notices you.

The Amusement Planet looks pretty much the way carnivals have looked 
for hundreds of years: harsh lights, all kinds of junk to eat, scary rides, loud noises.

After a minute''s walking around, 2-Tor edges close. "Don''t look now, Boss," he says.
"I have a strong sense we''re being followed." You sneak a look behind you, 
but all you see is a pile of garbage.

Then the "garbage" grabs you in an iron embrace.

"What folks are those?" asks 2-Tor, who wasn''t programmed with much of a sense of humor.

The two of you walk around, observing carefully while trying to look nonchalant. 
What you see looks pretty harmless. Rides, games of chance, cerebrographology booths, 
the usual. But you sense an un- dercurrent here that you don''t like. Something evil.

Humans have the low-level jobs of attending the attractions. But the bosses are 
aliens. Kron and some of the plantlike Brakhen from the Megellanic Clouds.

"May 1 make a suggestion, Boss?" asks Tor. "We might want to send for a xenologist."

"A xe-what?" you repeat.

"An expert in alien life forms. One might come in very handy, to let us know what they''re doing, and why."

shortly your xenologist beams in.

Her name is Dr. Caxton. She talks a lot about observation and alienography.

"Shall we have a look at the funhouse?" suggests 2-Tor. You both agree.

You buy your tickets for the funhouse, wondering what to expect. As you walk 
in, the real world falls away. The funhouse is a world of illusion, of fantasy. 
Everything around you changes from moment to moment. You''re in a desert, an ocean, 
the far reaches of drifting space. Your companions change constantly, too. 
You fight to remember where you are and who you''re with.

You do remember your mission, though, and it makes you nervous. "Let''s get going," 
you say. "Poke around a little. Stir things up."

Dr. Caxton disagrees. "I think that would be unwise," she says. "We should have a 
period of observation. We need more data on the Brakhen and their methods."')

good way to find out what''s going on. "We give up," you say.

protanium.

"This isn''t one of the regular attractions, is it?" you ask, shuddering.

"Shuddup," the Mungoid replies, pushing buttons on a console beside the door. 
The door opens with a roar.

What you find inside is staggering. It''s a room the size of a hangar, with thousands 
of small glass booths in it.

"2-Tor, what is this?" you gasp.

"An extremely advanced teleporter facility," he says. As your eyes get used to the 
light, you see humans and aliens in various stages of teleportation. Some of them 
are already half-invisible, on their way to unknown destinations. None of the travelers 
looks as if they want to go.

"Do you think you could break into the computer system and shut this thing down, 
Tor?" you whisper.

"Possibly," he says. "But shouldn''t we try to find out its purpose first?"

The Mungoid shoves you toward one of the booths.')

You flash past ride after ride, face after face. Hands grab at you as you run.

In desperation, you get an idea. The rides! You can use one to escape.

The Rocket Ride has just loaded up, and it''s already moving. You climb on. 
It cannonballs into the air, gathering speed.

When the rocket reaches its highest point, you hit the propulsion 
system in your suit. Whee-oo! You''re flying! You soar high above the 
lights and crowds, leaving them far behind.

At last you land. All around you are barren cliffs and crags. 
You haven''t looked behind you once.

"Well, 2-Tor, I guess we lost him," you pant. "There''s nobody here." 
Silence. "Tor?" He''s not with you!

It''s suicide to go back and get him. But you can''t just leave him 
with that many Mungoid.')

The two of you poke around, trying to look like any other innocent tourists. 
You even play a couple of games of boltbalk. You lose.

Just ahead of you is an immense building. Mammoth arches beckon you into it. 
The sign above the arches says THE COSMIC FUNHOUSE.

Just past the funhouse is a dark-looking tent. Its faded sign says 
SIDESHOW: THE HALL OF HORRORS.')

empty. * You turn to the Mungoid with your most charming smile. "Excuse me," you 
begin, "but perhaps we could talk about th â€” " The alien slams you into the side 
of the booth, then effortlessly picks you up and throws you inside. 2-Tor is thrown 
in beside you. Then the vacuum lock seals the door.

Every cell in your body is tingling with energy. But the world is fading fast 
around you. In the instant before you dematerialize, you pray that you and Tor will 
end up in the same place.

In the blink of an eye you''ve reached your destination. You look around warily. 
2-Tor hovers beside you, thank the Galaxy.

"Great idea!" you say. "That''s the last chrome/dome time I take your advice!"

"Wait," he whispers, ignoring your insults. "I''m picking up some seismic activity."

You feel a deep, frightening rumble. It shakes the ground beneath your feet. 
It grows more violent until a crevasse opens up in front of you. Finally the earth 
stops shaking. But you don''t.

"I have a fix on our location now," says 2-Tor. "We''re in Sector F8-347. This 
planet is a young one. It''s going through constant and rapid geologic change."')

Before you can absorb this awful idea, you hear a sharp thwip. The rock beside 
you has split open.

You look up. On a ridge above you are hundreds of creatures. They look half-human,
half-alien. Each one is different: some furred, some scaly, some slimy. They are armed
with primitive laser-guns.

"Mutants!" you cry. "Let''s get out of here, 2-Tor!"

"Right, Boss," he says, red lights flashing. "But where should we go?"')

breath, and make your way back. The place is like a giant rat-maze, and you sense 
danger at every turn.

In fact, there is danger. Mungoids are out in force, looking for you. 
They mean business, too.

Twice, you come face-to-face with them, and stun them with your micro-pulser. The only 
problem is that the effects of STUN don''t last very long. Any Mungoid you knock out will 
wake up in a few minutes. It doesn''t give you much time to act.

You keep calling 2-Tor. The communications system in your bio-support suit is connected 
to his. There''s a lot of interference from the funhouse. But if you''re close enough, 
he''ll hear you.')

"Hey, watch what you''re â€” " she begins, but she never finishes. The large and 
muscular alien has pushed her into a beam of bright blue light, where she stands 
transfixed, mouth open.

"That''s a teleporter beam," 2-Tor whistles. "I hope I can lead the frequencies in 
the beam, so we''ll have some rough coordinates for her destination."
"Quick, Tor!" you urge him. "Before she''s gone!"

She fades away as you watch helplessly. You see a pleading look in her eyes.

"I have some very rough data, Boss," says Tor. "but the coordinates are unfamiliar. 
It must be somewhere outside the Network of Worlds. I can''t be much help to you out 
there." Blue lights flash on his chest.

overhanging a steep ravine. Below you are many more green ledges, and at your back 
rises a steep cliff. You stand where you are, tryingto calm down. At least you''re safe where you are.

No, you''re not! The ledge below you is moving â€” almost as though it were alive. 
You look down. What does this thing remind you of? That''s it. A tongue! You look 
down the ravine. All the ledges are slowly stirring. They''re tongues, too. And they look hungry.

They don''t seem very fast, though. If you move quickly, you might be able to hop 
from tongue to tongue. That would get you to the bottom.

cliff. But who knows what surprises may be waiting for you up there?')

land like hail all around you. The ground starts heaving again.

After what seems like a long time, 2-Tor begins to click and buzz. He has the 
coordinates figured for the Challenger.

"Let''s warp out of here!" you yell. And as you beat a hasty retreat, you 
see the earth open up exactly where you were standing.

Seconds later you arrive at the Challenger, breathing a deep sigh of relief.

Your relief doesn''t last long, though. Something is very wrong here. For one thing, 
it''s a mess. For another, the shuttle now appears to have a crew. It didn''t have 
one when you left it.

A man dressed as first mate approaches you. "Good to see you back," he says, saluting.

come to find out about the funhouse.

"The machine may be tamper-proof. Or booby-trapped."

"Of course, "he answers. Since he''s hooked into the ship''s systems, it''s easy.
