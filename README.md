##Personal project recreating a choose-your-own-adventure book.##

As a kid I loved reading choose your own adventures.  This program is my attempt to recreate the experience of reading one of those classic books.  The text is from a book originally ublished in 1984.  

When I conceived of this idea, it seemed like it would be a simple undertaking.  The reality has proven a bit more difficult than I first thought.  My original plan was to write code for each choice, and select the text for that choice.  The choices branch out like a tree, and the code was becoming prohibitively long, and I was losing track of where the user was in the story. I have scrapped that idea (and a portion of that code) and am now going to add to the SQL server a table for choices and create a choice object in my program, which will be tied to the id for each page.  This way, I can select the choices that correspond with each page, and display the page chosen after the user makes their selection.
